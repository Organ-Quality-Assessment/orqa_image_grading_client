## Built With

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.4.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install Angular: `npm install -g @angular/cli`.


### Installation
`npm install`
or
`yarn install`

### Running Locally

Run `ng serve` or `yarn start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running Tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Deployment

### Local

Deploying to a production style setup but on the local system. Examples of this would include `venv`, `anaconda`, `Docker` or `minikube`. 

### Production

Deploying to the production system. Examples of this would include cloud, HPC or virtual machine. 

## Usage

Any links to production environment, video demos and screenshots.

## Roadmap

- [x] Initial Research  
- [ ] Minimum viable product <-- You are Here  
- [ ] Alpha Release  
- [ ] Feature-Complete Release  

## Contributing

### Main Branch
Protected and can only be pushed to via pull requests. Should be considered stable and a representation of production code.

### Dev Branch
Should be considered fragile, code should compile and run but features may be prone to errors.

### Feature Branches
A branch per feature being worked on.
